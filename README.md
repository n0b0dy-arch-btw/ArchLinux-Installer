# Arch Linux Automated Base Installer

This repository contains a **Bash script** and **configuration file** for automating a **base Arch Linux installation**.

Instead of manually typing every installation command, you just edit a small `install.conf` file with your preferences, and the script takes care of the rest.

## üìã Features
- Automated base Arch Linux installation using your configuration
- User-editable `install.conf` for keyboard layout, timezone, drive, locale, hostname, and root password
- Safety check before writing to your disk
- Fully scripted chroot configuration (no manual typing in `arch-chroot`)
- Minimal base install with `base`, `linux`, `linux-firmware`, and `nano`
- GRUB bootloader and NetworkManager pre-installed and enabled

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This script will **erase data** on the selected drive.  
Make sure you have backups of any important data before proceeding.

You are responsible for ensuring that your `install.conf` is correct.  
If you select the wrong drive, **it will be overwritten**.
